Senbon means “a thousand” — but not only in the literal sense. In the studio we use it to describe a swarm of quiet moments threaded together like lantern needles. I imagine a visitor stepping into the garden, brushing against light that remembers every conversation.  

To build that feeling into the interface, I mapped the hero to an asymmetrical grid and let each card glimmer at a slightly different delay. Framer Motion becomes a lantern choreographer, staggering petals and particles so the air never feels stale.  

### Ritual Notes

- Base palette starts with _koke_ (moss) and _akari_ (golden glow); overlays add hints of plum and tidewater blue.
- Every border receives a second inner line, like the double frame around shoji paper, to hint at gentle formality.
- Guestbook ink dries slower than journal ink. Pending entries pulse softly in the admin view to mimic warm wax.

Next up: translating the “thousand needles” metaphor into a Neon PostgreSQL schema that can scale while staying whisper-soft. I want each guestbook entry to feel handwritten even when it’s just JSON gliding through serverless space.
