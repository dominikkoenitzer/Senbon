There’s a soft rhythm in bamboo fountains: fill, bow, return. The guestbook moderation loop mimics that ritual. New entries arrive like water collecting in a ladle. The admin presses “approve” and the entry bows toward the garden stream. Rejecting is a gentle redirect — a different ripple, never a harsh splash.

### Implementation Drift

1. **Neon pulse** — serverless PostgreSQL idles quietly until someone speaks, then wakes with a shimmer. The SQL layer stores IP charcoal sketches so we can rate-limit without being rude.
2. **Token-only admin** — senbon is run by a tiny team. A single secret printed in the `.env` acts like a wooden key hung behind the gate.
3. **Animations** — Framer Motion loops handle floating talismans, while a custom canvas sprinkles particles that tilt toward the cursor like curious koi.

### Easter Egg Ledger

- Konami code unlocks a portal to `/constellation/senbon-grove`.
- The journal title on the home page hides the guest WiFi (kind of).
- Between 05:00–06:00 local time the site whispers about dew collecting on the moss. Catch it if you wake early.

Listening to water taught me that quiet interactions can still be playful. The blog now has enough soul to invite guests in; next step is teaching the admin dashboard to light up pending entries like stacked river stones.*** End Patch
